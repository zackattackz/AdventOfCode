# Advent of Code

Here are my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) (AoC) problems 

The root directory contains directories of solutions for given languages (e.g `py/`), and also a `inputs/` directory for each part's input.

In each language's directory, there are CLI programs for each language to be used to run any of my solutions for that given language. e.g. `py/runner` can be used as a driver for running the Python solution for any given Year/Day/Part of the calendar.

See README.md in the language-specific directory for instructions on how to operate it's runner.
