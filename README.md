# Advent of Code 2022

Here are my solutions to the [2022 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2022/)

From the root directory you can find solutions in specific languages. For example, the py/ directory contains solutions written in Python.

Each language's solutions also include a runner written in that language. e.g. py/runner.py can be used as a driver for running the solution for any given Day/Part of the calendar.

See README.md in the language-specific directory for instructions on how to operate the runner for that language.
